<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi! I’m Anees, a BSCS student at the University of Central Punjab with a solid
  foundation in programming and problem-solving. I’ve completed core courses
  like ITC, Programming Fundamentals, OOP, and Data Structures & Algorithms, and
  I enjoy turning concepts into working, efficient code.
</p>
<p>
  My primary language is C++, and I focus on writing clean, readable solutions
  without unnecessary libraries. I like building things from scratch to fully
  understand the logic and performance trade-offs.
</p>
<p>
  I’ve worked on a game development project as my final semester project, which
  strengthened my grasp of OOP design, state management, and real-time problem
  solving. That experience taught me how to break big ideas into testable,
  modular components.
</p>
<p>
  Right now, I’m designing an AI chatbot for a school management
  system—streamlining routine queries, improving response time, and making
  information easier to access for students and staff. This project reflects my
  interest in practical AI that solves real problems.
</p>
<p>
  Beyond coursework, I keep sharpening my DSA skills and explore software
  engineering best practices. I enjoy challenges that require thoughtful data
  structures, algorithmic efficiency, and careful attention to edge cases.
</p>
<p>
  Tools I’m comfortable with include Visual Studio (VS 2022) and standard C++
  build workflows. I prefer simple, dependable setups that let me focus on logic
  and clarity.
</p>
<p>
  My goals are to grow into a versatile software engineer, contribute to
  impactful products, and keep learning—whether that’s deeper systems work,
  smarter chatbots, or performance-minded application design.
</p>
<p>
  If you’re looking for someone who is curious, disciplined, and committed to
  continuous improvement, I’d love to connect and collaborate.
</p>
